a Gui that can download and play youtube videos


so its a gui that can download videos loop , sound etc . just press open video insert the link or youtube video name...(based on yt search engine so you need a detailed name)
if it doesnt work do in console
```
pip install pytube --upgrade
```

if it still doesnt work it needs to be fixed :(
also you may need to change the code so it works for you just some paths...

TODO:
1.make a thread for the unittest class ( so the gui doesnt freeze when you use the search engine)
2. add changing paths
3. add exception when downloading for Error 403 forbidden
4. add app icon
